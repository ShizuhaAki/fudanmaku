# Fudanmaku
Fudanmaku (**Fu**nctional **Danmaku**).

## Installation
Fudanmaku reads source files (conventionally named with `.fdm`), and produces a S-expression based file describing, frame by frame, how bullets shall be placed (we call that the Fudanmaku Transfer Language, `.ftl`).

Fudanmaku itself requires only pure Racket to run. However, to see your output visualized, you need to install the following Python packages:

```
pip3 install pygame sexpdata
```

After that, you may run and visualize your source file as such
